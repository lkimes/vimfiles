This file is just some helpful learning items for vim

:scriptnames - to list all the bundles installed
:so $MYVIMRC - to source my _vimrc

To get submodules to work they must be added as submodule
If the directory already exists then remove it from git (git rm /bundle/<dir>)
git submodule add <git repo> bundle/<normally name like syntastic>

To verify that it is ok then
git status

From remote to make sure you have sync'd your submodules:
git submodule init (I think first time something gets added)
git submodule update
